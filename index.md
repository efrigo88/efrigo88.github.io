### [The Ollama Odyssey: Lessons from Running High-Throughput LLM Serving in Production](ollama-infrastructure-challenges.html)

*Published: January 2025*

A deep dive into the challenges we faced running Ollama for self-hosted LLM inference in a production RAG pipeline. This post covers:

- 6 major stability issues (constant hangs, context window problems, Qwen model instability)
- GPU infrastructure challenges (PCIe bottlenecks on g5.12xlarge)
- Our subprocess-based timeout solution (the "band-aid")
- Why we migrated to AWS Bedrock + OpenRouter
- Cost analysis and lessons learned
- Future plans with vLLM

**Key takeaway**: Start with APIs, optimize later. Stability and development velocity are more valuable than theoretical cost savings.
